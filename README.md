## Project Overview

A simple, interactive blackjack card game built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project is **a refined version of a university assessment**, enhanced with additional features and improvements. The game allows you to practice your blackjack skills and keeps track of basic statistics (wins, losses, and draws) using the browserâ€™s local storage.

### Features

- **Realistic Blackjack Mechanics**  
  Players can hit, stand, and experience dealer draws until the dealer reaches at least 17. The Ace can act as 1 or 11.

- **Dealer/Player Score Tracking**  
  Scores are automatically updated and displayed for both the player and the dealer.

- **Win/Loss/Draw Statistics**  
  The game keeps a tally of wins, losses, and draws locally, so your stats persist between sessions (in the same browser).

- **Interactive UI**  
  A clean visual presentation, with card flipping, hover animations, and simple transitions.

## How to Run

1. **Clone or Download** the files from this README (the HTML, CSS, and JS).
2. **Open** the `index.html` file in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
3. **Start Playing**:
    - Click the **Deal** button to start a new round.
    - Click **Hit** to draw another card.
    - Click **Stand** to let the dealer draw until they have 17 or more.
    - Observe the result of the round and continue playing!

No server setup is required; simply double-clicking or opening the `index.html` file in your browser should work. However, some browsers or security policies may require you to serve the files via a local server for local storage to function properly. In most cases, it will work by opening the HTML file directly.
